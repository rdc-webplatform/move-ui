      About Move UI:
      Formerly branded as Real Estate UI, Move UI has thousands of stars on GitHub, ranking among the most popular React UI component libraries. The components rely on React, and also leverage styled-components. For those of you who need filling in, our Design takes inspiration from the physical world and textures while keeping the actual UI elements to a minimum.
      A wide range of helpful components are available, like app bars, auto complete, badges, buttons, cards, dialog boxes, icons, menus, sliders and more. Helpfully, Move UI also offers React themes and templates, so you can have a custom color theme for your app.
      We plan on doing all that cultivating our values:

      <p>Customer obsessed. We put our customers front & center.</p>


      <p>Transparency. Most of our work is public.</p>


      <p>Freedom. We work from anywhere in the world.</p>


      <p>Autonomy. We want to create a safe, high-trust team.</p>

      <p>Excellence. We're aiming high, and we know it.</p>
    </h3>
